  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I have lived a thousand lives and loved a thousand loves... and run into a thousand dumb characters while I was at it.</p> 
  <p>Hi reader, my name is Ashley. I am currently a third year college student studying information systems. The content on this website is far from what I am studying, you're probably wondering why I have it. 
    When I am not doing schoolwork and homework, you can catch me lost in a totally different world.
  This could be through a book, movie, tv show, or disengaging with the real world by getting lost within a song's sound waves.
  </p>
	<p>Growing up I always loved reading and watching movies and TV shows. Before I was old enough to attend school I would watch movies and old Asian dramas with my dad. 
    When he left for work and my mom got home I would be given books or coloring books to keep busy while my mom studied. When I started attending school I would spend more of my time sitting in the class library rather than with the toys.
  When we had specials, everyone else dreaded library day, but that was always my favorite day. Where I grew up it was hard for me to make friends and connect with other kids, so I ended up connecting with fictional characters to not feel alone.     </p>
